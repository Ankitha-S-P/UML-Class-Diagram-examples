# UML-Class-Diagram-examples
 Overview
Definition: Class diagrams are a type of static structure diagram in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that describe the system's structure by showing its classes, attributes, operations, and the relationships among objects.
Purpose: They are used to model the design of a system, visualize the structure, and communicate the system's architecture among stakeholders.
2. Key Components
Class: Represents a blueprint of objects, encapsulating data and behavior. It is depicted as a rectangle with three compartments:

Top Compartment: Class name.
Middle Compartment: Attributes (data members or properties).
Bottom Compartment: Operations (methods or functions).
Attributes: Variables that hold the state of a class. They have visibility markers:

Public (+): Accessible from outside the class.
Private (-): Accessible only within the class.
Protected (#): Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
Operations: Functions or methods that define the behavior of a class. They also have visibility markers similar to attributes.

Relationships: Show how classes interact or are connected to each other.

Association: A structural relationship that represents links between instances of classes.
Multiplicity: Indicates the number of instances involved in a relationship.
Aggregation: A special type of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship, where the part can exist independently of the whole.
Composition: A stronger form of aggregation, where the part cannot exist without the whole.
Inheritance (Generalization): Represents a hierarchical relationship where a child class inherits from a parent class.
Dependency: Indicates that a class relies on another class to function.
